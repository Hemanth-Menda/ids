 - ids is a Python library that is intended to implement Python data structures instantaneously
 - this is a development module and never intended for serious projects
 - the project is intended to implement multiple complex datastructures in python such as the
-       Linked List
-       Doubly Linked List
-       circular Linked List
-       Quees
-       Stacks
-       Trees
-       Graphs
  The library is also expected to add high functionality to these datastructures.
